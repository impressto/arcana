## üìã Decision Log

### Custom Confirmation Modals Implementation
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Description:** Replace all browser confirm dialogs with custom styled modal components  
**Rationale:** Browser confirm dialogs break the visual consistency of the application and provide poor UX. Custom modals offer better styling, clearer messaging, and consistent behavior across browsers  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** Professional appearance, consistent UX, better user messaging with warning/danger styling  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, End Users  
**Implementation:** Created reusable `ConfirmationModal.tsx` component with type variants (warning, danger) and replaced window.confirm in both StepNavigation and DocumentWizard components  

### Use Sample Button Implementation
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Description:** Add direct sample document loading without download/upload flow  
**Rationale:** Original flow required users to download sample files and re-upload them, creating unnecessary friction and poor first-time user experience  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** Significantly improved user onboarding, reduced steps to try platform features  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, End Users  
**Implementation:** Enhanced DocumentWizard with handleUseSample function, integrated with shared markdown parsers, added confirmation modal for data safety  

### Shared Markdown Parser Architecture
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Description:** Extract markdown parsing logic into centralized utility functions  
**Rationale:** Parsing logic was duplicated between ImportModal and DocumentWizard, creating maintenance burden and inconsistency risk  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** Improved maintainability, consistent parsing behavior, easier testing and debugging  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team  
**Implementation:** Created `/src/utils/markdownParsers.ts` with parseSpecMarkdownContent and parseMemoryMarkdownContent functions including robust error handling  

### Removal of Non-Functional Complete Button  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Description:** Remove disabled "Complete" button from final wizard step  
**Rationale:** Button appeared clickable but was disabled with no functionality, causing user confusion and support requests  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** Cleaner UI, reduced user confusion, eliminated false affordances  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, UX, Support Team  
**Implementation:** Modified StepNavigation.tsx to conditionally render Next button only when not on final step  

### Start Over Confirmation Implementation
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Description:** Add confirmation dialog for Start Over functionality  
**Rationale:** Users frequently lost work by accidentally clicking "Start Over", leading to frustration and abandonment  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** Prevents accidental data loss, increases user confidence in navigation  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, End Users  
**Implementation:** Added confirmation modal with clear warning message about data loss and action irreversibility  

### CSS Specificity Fix for Input Field Padding
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Description:** Fix issue where `pl-12` and other padding utilities don't work with `input-field` class  
**Rationale:** The `input-field` class uses `@apply px-3` which has higher CSS specificity than utility classes, preventing custom padding from working  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** Developers can now use Tailwind padding utilities with input-field class for custom layouts (search inputs with icons, etc.)  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team  
**Implementation:** Added specific CSS overrides with `!important` for common padding utilities (pl-8, pl-10, pl-12, pr-8, pr-10, pr-12) in index.css

### Documentation Structure Organization
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Description:** Implement structured docs folder with spec and memory separation  
**Rationale:** Better organization enables AI assistants to reference project context more effectively and improves maintainability
