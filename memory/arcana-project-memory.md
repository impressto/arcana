*Generated using Arcana Documentation Wizard*  
*Last Updated: October 2, 2025*

## üè¢ Project Information

**Project Name:** Arcana Documentation Platform  
**Description:** A modern, wizard-driven documentation platform that helps organizations create professional specification documents and maintain organizational memory. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, featuring an intuitive step-by-step interface.  
**Team:** Development Team (impressto), Product Owner, QA Team  
**Start Date:** 2024  
**Current Phase:** Active Development & Enhancement  

## üìã Decision Log

### Use Sample Button Implementation
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Description:** Decision to add a "Use Sample" button that loads sample documents directly without requiring download/upload  
**Rationale:** Users were forced to download sample files and re-upload them, creating unnecessary friction in the user experience  
**Status:** Decided  
**Impact:** Significantly improves user onboarding and reduces steps to try the platform  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, End Users  
**Alternatives:** Keep the download-upload flow, Create inline preview without loading  
**Implementation:** Created shared markdown parsers in `/src/utils/markdownParsers.ts` and enhanced `DocumentWizard.tsx` to use proper parsing instead of hardcoded samples  

### Removal of Non-Functional Complete Button  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Description:** Decision to remove the disabled "Complete" button that appeared on the final wizard step  
**Rationale:** The button was confusing users as it appeared clickable but was disabled and had no functionality  
**Status:** Decided  
**Impact:** Cleaner UI and less user confusion on the final step  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, UX  
**Alternatives:** Make the button functional, Keep it but improve styling  
**Implementation:** Modified `StepNavigation.tsx` to conditionally render the Next button only when not on the last step  

### Start Over Confirmation Dialog
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Description:** Decision to add a confirmation dialog when users click the "Start Over" button  
**Rationale:** Users could accidentally lose their work by clicking "Start Over" without warning, causing frustration and lost productivity  
**Status:** Decided  
**Impact:** Prevents accidental data loss and improves user confidence when navigating the wizard  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, End Users  
**Alternatives:** Remove the Start Over button, Move it to a less prominent location, Add an undo feature  
**Implementation:** Added `handleStartOver` function in `StepNavigation.tsx` with `window.confirm()` before calling `resetWizard()`  

### Technology Stack Selection
**Date:** 2024 (Initial Project)  
**Description:** Selection of React + TypeScript + Vite for the frontend stack  
**Rationale:** Modern development experience, excellent TypeScript support, fast build times, component-based architecture suitable for wizard UI  
**Status:** Decided  
**Impact:** Fast development cycles, type safety, good developer experience  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team  
**Alternatives:** Vue.js + TypeScript, Angular, Plain JavaScript  

### Wizard-Based UI Pattern
**Date:** 2024 (Initial Project)  
**Description:** Decision to use a step-by-step wizard interface instead of a single-page form  
**Rationale:** Complex documentation has many sections; wizard pattern reduces cognitive load and guides users through the process  
**Status:** Decided  
**Impact:** Better user experience for complex document creation, higher completion rates  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, UX Design, End Users  
**Alternatives:** Single page with sections, Tabbed interface, Accordion-style form  

## üìö Glossary

**Wizard Pattern:** A UI design pattern that breaks complex processes into multiple sequential steps, showing one step at a time with navigation controls  
**Memory Document:** A type of documentation that captures organizational knowledge including decisions, lessons learned, meeting notes, and team information  
**Specification Document:** Technical documentation that outlines project requirements, architecture, APIs, and implementation details  
**Markdown Parser:** Code component that converts markdown text into structured data objects for use in the application  
**Step Navigation:** UI component that handles moving between wizard steps and shows current progress  
**Import Modal:** Dialog component that allows users to upload and parse existing markdown documents  
**Sample Documents:** Pre-created example documents used to demonstrate platform capabilities and help users understand expected formats  

## ü§ù Meeting Notes

### Project Enhancement Session
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Attendees:** Development Team, Product Owner  
**Agenda:**
- Review user feedback about sample document flow
- Discuss UI improvements needed
- Plan implementation approach

**Notes:** 
Users reported confusion with the current sample document flow requiring download then upload. The "Complete" button on final step was also identified as confusing since it doesn't work. Decided to implement direct sample loading and remove the non-functional button.

**Action Items:**
- [x] Implement "Use Sample" button with direct loading (Development Team - Oct 2, 2025)
- [x] Remove non-functional Complete button (Development Team - Oct 2, 2025)
- [ ] Test the changes with users (QA Team - Pending)
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect changes (Development Team - Pending)

## üí° Lessons Learned

### Shared Utility Functions Improve Maintainability
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Category:** Code Architecture  
**Situation:** The markdown parsing logic was duplicated between ImportModal and DocumentWizard components, making maintenance difficult  
**Lesson:** When the same complex logic is needed in multiple places, extract it to a shared utility module immediately  
**Application:** Created `/src/utils/markdownParsers.ts` to centralize all parsing logic  
**Impact:** High - Easier to maintain, test, and extend parsing functionality  

### User Testing Reveals Hidden UX Issues
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Category:** User Experience  
**Situation:** The non-functional "Complete" button seemed obvious to developers but was confusing to users  
**Lesson:** What seems logical to developers may not be intuitive to users; regular user testing is essential  
**Application:** Remove elements that don't provide clear value, ensure all interactive elements are functional  
**Impact:** Medium - Cleaner interface reduces user confusion  

### Progressive Enhancement Over Feature Bloat
**Date:** 2024-2025 (Ongoing)  
**Category:** Product Development  
**Situation:** Initial temptation to add many features at once vs. building a solid core experience first  
**Lesson:** Focus on core functionality and user experience before adding advanced features  
**Application:** Prioritize wizard flow improvements and usability over new document types or advanced features  
**Impact:** High - Better user adoption and satisfaction with a polished core experience  

## üë• Onboarding Notes

### New Team Member - Frontend Developer
**Status:** In Progress  
**Department:** Engineering  
**Start Date:** 2024  
**Mentor:** Technical Lead  

**Onboarding Tasks:**
- [x] Set up development environment (Node.js, npm, VS Code)
- [x] Clone repository and run local development server
- [x] Review codebase structure and component architecture
- [x] Understand wizard context and state management
- [x] Learn TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- [ ] Complete first feature implementation
- [ ] Review and understand markdown parsing logic
- [ ] Practice with sample document creation

**Resources:**
- üìö React Documentation (documentation)
- üìö TypeScript Handbook (documentation)
- üìö Vite Guide (documentation)
- üìö Project README (documentation)
- üìö Component Documentation (internal)

**Notes:**
Developer is progressing well through the codebase. Strong React background helps with understanding the wizard pattern. TypeScript knowledge needs some strengthening but improving quickly.

**Feedback:** 
Codebase is well-structured and easy to understand. The wizard context pattern makes state management clear. Documentation could be improved with more inline comments for complex parsing logic.

**Completion Date:** Expected Q4 2024
