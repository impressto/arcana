# Using Arcana Documents to Enhance AI Assistance

The Arcana project includes comprehensive specification and memory documents in the `public/` folder that can significantly improve the quality of AI assistance you receive. Here's how to leverage them effectively.

## 📂 Available Documents

- **`sample-spec-document.md`** - Complete project specification including requirements, architecture, and roadmap
- **`sample-memory-document.md`** - Project memory document with decisions, lessons learned, and team knowledge

## 🤖 AI Context Enhancement

### Quick Usage

The easiest way to get AI help is to include relevant sections from these documents in your prompts:

```typescript
// Use the AI Context Builder utility
import { getAIContextForTask } from './src/utils/aiContextBuilder';

// For implementing new features
const context = await getAIContextForTask('feature');

// For debugging issues  
const context = await getAIContextForTask('bug');

// For architectural decisions
const context = await getAIContextForTask('architecture');
```

### Manual Context Building

You can also manually extract relevant sections:

```markdown
# Context for AI Assistant

## Project Overview
[Copy the Project Overview section from sample-spec-document.md]

## Technical Stack
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons

## Key Architectural Decisions
[Copy relevant decisions from the Decision Log in sample-memory-document.md]

## Current Challenge
[Describe your specific question or issue]
```

## 🎯 Practical Examples

### Example 1: Implementing a New Feature

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
I'm working on the Arcana documentation platform. Here's the project context:

[Include Project Overview from spec document]
[Include Technical Requirements from spec document]
[Include React 19 Architecture Decision from memory document]

I want to implement a new feature that allows users to save documents as drafts. How should I approach this considering our current architecture?
```

### Example 2: Debugging an Issue

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
I'm debugging an issue in the Arcana project. Here's the relevant context:

[Include Technical Architecture from spec document]
[Include Lessons Learned about TypeScript and State Management from memory document]

I'm seeing TypeScript errors when trying to update the wizard state. The error is: [paste error]
Based on our architecture decisions and past lessons, what's the best way to fix this?
```

### Example 3: Architecture Decision

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
I need to make an architectural decision for the Arcana platform. Context:

[Include all Decision Log entries from memory document]
[Include Non-Functional Requirements from spec document]

We're considering adding real-time collaboration features. Based on our existing decisions and constraints, what approach would you recommend?
```

## 🛠️ Using the AI Context Builder

The project includes a utility class `AIContextBuilder` that automates context extraction:

```typescript
import { AIContextBuilder } from './src/utils/aiContextBuilder';

const builder = new AIContextBuilder();
await builder.loadSampleDocuments();

// Get project overview for context
const overview = builder.extractProjectOverview();

// Get architecture decisions
const decisions = builder.extractArchitectureDecisions();

// Get lessons learned
const lessons = builder.extractLessonsLearned();

// Build comprehensive context
const fullContext = builder.buildAIContext({
  includeSpecs: true,
  includeDecisions: true,
  includeLessonsLearned: true,
  includeArchitecture: true
});
```

## 🎨 Integration Examples

### With ChatGPT
1. Copy the generated context from the AI Context Builder
2. Paste it at the beginning of your ChatGPT conversation
3. Ask your specific question
4. ChatGPT will have full project context for better responses

### With Claude
1. Use the context as a "document" in Claude's interface
2. Reference it when asking questions about the project
3. Claude can analyze the documents and provide project-aware responses

### With GitHub Copilot
1. Open the relevant document files in your editor
2. Reference them in comments when asking for code suggestions
3. Copilot will use the open files as context

## 📊 What Each Document Provides

### Specification Document (`sample-spec-document.md`)
- **Project Overview**: Business context and objectives
- **Functional Requirements**: User stories and features
- **Technical Requirements**: Architecture and technology stack
- **API Documentation**: Interface specifications
- **Performance Metrics**: Benchmarks and targets
- **Security Requirements**: Privacy and security measures
- **Roadmap**: Development phases and timeline

### Memory Document (`sample-memory-document.md`)
- **Decision Log**: Why specific technical choices were made
- **Lessons Learned**: What worked, what didn't, and why
- **Glossary**: Project-specific terminology
- **Meeting Notes**: Important discussions and outcomes
- **Onboarding Notes**: Team knowledge and processes

## 🔄 Keeping Documents Updated

To maintain effectiveness:

1. **Regular Updates**: Update documents as the project evolves
2. **Decision Tracking**: Add new architectural decisions to the memory document
3. **Lesson Capture**: Document new lessons learned after major features
4. **Context Refresh**: Regenerate AI contexts when documents change

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Better AI Responses
- Include specific error messages or code snippets
- Reference particular sections from the documents
- Provide context about what you've already tried
- Ask follow-up questions to clarify solutions

### For Consistent Results
- Use the same document structure for all AI interactions
- Create templates for common types of questions
- Build a library of successful AI prompts
- Share effective prompts with your team

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Context Building
```typescript
// Build context for specific scenarios
const customContext = builder.buildAIContext({
  includeSpecs: true,
  includeDecisions: true,
  includeGlossary: true,
  // Only include what's relevant to your question
});
```

### Integration with Development Workflow
```typescript
// In your development tools
const generatePRContext = async (prDescription: string) => {
  const context = await getAIContextForTask('feature');
  return `${context}\n\nPull Request: ${prDescription}\n\nPlease review this change.`;
};
```

By leveraging these documents effectively, you can get much more accurate and project-aware assistance from AI tools, leading to better code, faster development, and more informed architectural decisions.
