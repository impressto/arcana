# GitHub Copilot Context for Arcana Project

## üéØ Always Reference These Documents

**CRITICAL: Read these files before making any code suggestions or changes:**

1. **[Project Specification](./docs/spec/arcana-project-spec.md)** - Complete technical requirements, architecture, and API specs
2. **[Project Memory](./docs/memory/arcana-project-memory.md)** - Decision history, lessons learned, team knowledge
3. **[AI Copilot Guide](./docs/AI_COPILOT_GUIDE.md)** - Detailed prompts and patterns for this project

## üöÄ Quick Context

**Project:** Arcana - React 19 + TypeScript + Vite documentation wizard platform  
**Focus:** Custom confirmation modals, sample document loading, UX improvements  
**Architecture:** Component-based with React Context, Tailwind CSS, defensive programming  
**Recent:** Replaced browser confirms with custom modals, enhanced error handling, structured docs  

## üí° Key Patterns to Follow

- **Modals:** Always use `ConfirmationModal` component instead of `window.confirm`
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try/catch with meaningful user messages
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode with proper interfaces and null checks
- **State:** Use React Context (useWizard) for global wizard state
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes with consistent design system

## üìù When to Update Documentation

**Update Project Memory for:**
- New architectural decisions
- UX improvements and rationale  
- Bug fixes with lessons learned
- Team changes or onboarding

**Update Project Spec for:**
- New features or capabilities
- API changes or requirements
- Technology stack modifications

## üîß Common Tasks

**New Component:** Reference existing patterns in `src/components/`, use TypeScript interfaces, include accessibility  
**Bug Fix:** Check project memory for similar issues, add comprehensive error handling  
**Feature Enhancement:** Ensure backward compatibility, maintain wizard flow consistency

**Always ask: "What does the project spec say about this?" and "What lessons learned apply here?"**
