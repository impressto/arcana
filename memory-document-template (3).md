## üè¢ Project Information

**Project Name:** iHasco Dev Docker Environment

**Team:** Development Team  
**Start Date:** [Project start date]

**Repository:** https://github.com/ihasco/dev_docker  
**Live Demo:** https://app.ihasco.local (local development environment)  

## üìã Decision Log

### Local Base Image Creation for Application Service
**Date:** 2025-09-26  
**Description:** Created local Docker base images to avoid ECR authentication issues during development  
**Rationale:** Original setup required AWS ECR authentication for base images, causing build failures for developers without proper AWS credentials. Local base images eliminate this dependency.  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** High - Enables developers to build locally without AWS ECR access  
**Stakeholders:** All developers working on the Application service  
**Implementation:** Created `/home/dev/ihasco/Application/.docker/base-local.Dockerfile` and `/home/dev/ihasco/Application/.docker/Dockerfile.no-newrelic` to build base images locally without New Relic dependencies  

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **AWS ECR Authentication:** Would require all developers to have AWS credentials configured
- **Public Docker Hub Images:** Security concerns and lack of control over base image contents

**Follow-up Actions:**
- [x] Update core.sh to build local base images (Developer - 2025-09-26)
- [x] Create Dockerfiles without New Relic installation (Developer - 2025-09-26)
- [x] Update docker-compose.yml to use local Dockerfiles (Developer - 2025-09-26)

### MySQL Host Configuration Change
**Date:** 2025-09-16  
**Description:** Switched from containerized MySQL to host-based MySQL using host.docker.internal  
**Rationale:** Provides persistent database storage, easier access from desktop tools, and potentially better performance than containerized MySQL  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** Medium - Affects database connectivity and persistence  
**Stakeholders:** All developers, Database administrators  
**Implementation:** Updated all .env files to use `host.docker.internal` as DB_HOST, removed MySQL container from docker-compose.yml  

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Keep MySQL in container:** Would require volume management and complex networking
- **External database service:** Would require additional infrastructure setup

**Follow-up Actions:**
- [x] Update environment files with host.docker.internal (Developer - 2025-09-16)
- [x] Remove MySQL container definition (Developer - 2025-09-16)
- [x] Test connectivity from all services (Developer - 2025-09-16)

### Application Container Networking Fix
**Date:** 2025-09-16  
**Description:** Fixed Application container network connectivity by connecting to ihasco_local network with correct alias  
**Rationale:** Nginx was unable to reach the Application container because it was running on a different Docker network  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** High - Critical for application functionality  
**Stakeholders:** All developers  
**Implementation:** Connected Application container to ihasco_local network with alias `application_project_1` to match Nginx configuration  

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Update Nginx configuration:** Would require changing existing working configurations
- **Use IP addresses:** Less maintainable and fragile

**Follow-up Actions:**
- [x] Connect Application container to ihasco_local network (Developer - 2025-09-16)
- [x] Add network alias application_project_1 (Developer - 2025-09-16)
- [x] Test Nginx to Application connectivity (Developer - 2025-09-16)

## üí° Lessons Learned

### Docker Network Configuration Complexity
**Date:** 2025-09-16  
**Category:** Technical  
**Situation:** Application container was unreachable from Nginx due to different Docker networks  
**Lesson:** Container networking requires careful attention to network aliases and inter-service communication patterns  
**Application:** Always verify container network connectivity when adding new services or changing network configurations  
**Impact:** High - Critical for service functionality and can be difficult to debug  

### ECR Dependency Management
**Date:** 2025-09-26  
**Category:** Technical  
**Situation:** Developers unable to build locally due to AWS ECR authentication requirements  
**Lesson:** External dependencies (like ECR) should be minimized in local development environments to reduce friction  
**Application:** Create local alternatives for external dependencies when possible, especially for base images  
**Impact:** High - Significantly improves developer experience and reduces setup complexity  

### Environment File Management
**Date:** 2025-09-16  
**Category:** Project Management  
**Situation:** Multiple environment files needed updates for host configuration changes  
**Lesson:** Centralized environment configuration management is crucial for maintaining consistency across services  
**Application:** Consider using environment file templates or automated updating scripts for large changes  
**Impact:** Medium - Reduces manual errors and ensures consistency
