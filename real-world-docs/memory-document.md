## üìã Decision Log

### Technology Stack Selection
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Description:** Selected React for frontend and Node.js for backend socket server  
**Rationale:** React provides robust component-based architecture for real-time collaborative UI, Node.js enables efficient WebSocket handling and is well-suited for real-time applications  
**Status:** Decided  
**Impact:** High - Foundation for entire application architecture  
**Stakeholders:** Development team  
**Implementation:** To be implemented during development phase  

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Vue.js + Express:** Considered but React has better WebRTC ecosystem support
- **Vanilla JS + Socket.io:** Would be lighter but more complex to maintain for collaborative features

**Follow-up Actions:**
- [ ] Set up React development environment (Dev Team - TBD)
- [ ] Create Node.js socket server structure (Dev Team - TBD)

### WebRTC with WebSocket Fallback Architecture
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Description:** Implement WebRTC as primary connection method with WebSocket fallback for restricted networks  
**Rationale:** WebRTC provides direct peer-to-peer communication with lower latency, but mobile networks often block it, requiring WebSocket fallback via socket.impressto.ca  
**Status:** Decided  
**Impact:** High - Core communication strategy affects all real-time features  
**Stakeholders:** Development team, end users on mobile networks  
**Implementation:** To be implemented with connection detection and automatic fallback  

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **WebSocket only:** Simpler but higher server load and latency
- **WebRTC only:** Better performance but would fail on restricted networks

**Follow-up Actions:**
- [ ] Implement WebRTC connection establishment (Dev Team - TBD)
- [ ] Create WebSocket fallback detection (Dev Team - TBD)
- [ ] Set up socket.impressto.ca server (Dev Team - TBD)

---

### Anonymous Usage Model
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Description:** No user authentication required, sessions accessible via URL hash  
**Rationale:** Simplifies user experience, reduces privacy concerns, faster session initiation  
**Status:** Decided  
**Impact:** Medium - Affects security model and user management  
**Stakeholders:** Development team, end users  
**Implementation:** Sessions identified by URL hash, no user accounts or authentication  

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **User accounts:** Would provide better session management but adds complexity
- **Guest accounts:** Middle ground but still adds unnecessary friction

**Follow-up Actions:**
- [ ] Design session URL hash generation (Dev Team - TBD)
- [ ] Implement session management without authentication (Dev Team - TBD)

---

### Frontend Build Tooling Selection
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Description:** Selected Vite as build tool and Yarn as package manager for React frontend  
**Rationale:** Vite provides fast development server with hot module replacement, optimized for modern React development. Yarn offers reliable dependency management and faster installs than npm  
**Status:** Decided  
**Impact:** Medium - Affects development workflow and build process  
**Stakeholders:** Development team  
**Implementation:** To be implemented during frontend setup  

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Create React App + npm:** Traditional approach but slower dev server and larger bundle
- **Webpack + npm:** More configuration required, slower than Vite

**Follow-up Actions:**
- [x] Initialize React project with Vite (Dev Team - 2025-10-04)
- [x] Configure Yarn for package management (Dev Team - 2025-10-04)

- [x] Set up git repository with proper .gitignore (Dev Team - 2025-10-04)

---

### Project Repository Initialization  
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Description:** Initialized git repository with proper .gitignore configuration for frontend and backend  
**Rationale:** Proper version control setup prevents tracking of node_modules and sensitive files, ensures clean repository history  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** Medium - Foundation for version control and collaboration  
**Stakeholders:** Development team  
**Implementation:** Created root .gitignore covering both client and socket-server directories, made initial commit  

**Follow-up Actions:**
- [x] Create root-level .gitignore (Dev Team - 2025-10-04)
- [x] Initial git commit (Dev Team - 2025-10-04)

---

### Multi-User Collaboration Testing Success
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Description:** Successfully tested and verified real-time collaborative editing between multiple clients  
**Rationale:** Confirming core functionality works before building additional features ensures solid foundation  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Impact:** High - Core product functionality validated  
**Stakeholders:** Development team, end users  
**Implementation:** Verified multiple browser clients can join same session and see real-time text updates from other users  

**Test Results:**
- **WebSocket Connection:** ‚úÖ Multiple clients connect successfully

## üí° Lessons Learned

### Session Management Debugging
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Category:** Technical  
**Situation:** Multi-user collaboration wasn't working because each browser tab was generating its own unique session ID, putting users in different sessions instead of the same collaborative session  
**Lesson:** Always verify that multiple clients are connecting to the same session when testing collaborative features. Session isolation can make it appear that real-time sync is broken when it's actually working correctly within each session  
**Application:** Added session input field for manual session joining, improved debugging with server logs showing session IDs, and documented the need to share complete URLs (including hash fragments) for collaboration  
**Impact:** High - Critical for multi-user functionality testing and user experience  

---

### Spec-Driven Development Process
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Category:** Project Management  
**Situation:** First time implementing spec-driven development approach with living documentation  
**Lesson:** Keep specifications detailed with acceptance criteria, update both spec and memory docs continuously, and use user stories to drive feature development rather than technical tasks  
**Application:** Enhanced spec document with acceptance criteria, added testing validation section, improved traceability between requirements and implementation  
**Impact:** Medium - Improves development process and quality assurance
