## üîå API Documentation

**Note:** Arcana is a client-side application with no backend API requirements. All data persistence is handled through browser localStorage.

### LocalStorage API

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Stored as 'arcana-state' in localStorage
{
  documentType: 'spec' | 'memory',
  currentStep: number,
  completedSteps: number[],
  specData?: SpecificationData,
  memoryData?: MemoryData,
  lastSaved: string (ISO timestamp)
}
```

**Storage Methods:**
- **Auto-save:** Triggered every 10 seconds when data changes
- **Manual save:** Triggered on step navigation and form submission
- **Data validation:** Type checking and structure validation before storage
- **Error handling:** Graceful fallback when localStorage is unavailable

### Host Page Integration API

**Element Control Functions:**
```javascript
// Hide elements on host page
hideHostElementWithMemory(elementId: string): boolean

// Restore previously hidden elements  
restoreHostElement(elementId: string): boolean

// Check if element exists and is visible
isElementVisible(elementId: string): boolean
```

**Usage Examples:**
```javascript
// Automatically triggered when wizard starts
hideHostElementWithMemory('arcana-info-box');

// Automatically triggered when wizard resets
restoreHostElement('arcana-info-box');
```
