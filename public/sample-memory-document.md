## üéì Lessons Learned

### Database Connection Pooling Issues

**Date:** 2025-01-20
**Category:** Technical
**Impact:** high
**Situation:** Application started experiencing intermittent database connection timeouts during peak usage periods, causing service disruptions.
**Lesson:** Connection pool configuration was inadequate for production load. Default settings worked fine in development but couldn't handle concurrent user requests.
**Application:** Always load test with realistic connection patterns. Configure connection pools based on expected concurrent users, not development usage. Implement proper monitoring for connection pool metrics.

## üéì Lessons Learned

### React 19 Upgrade Timing

**Date:** March 8, 2024  
**Category:** Technical  
**Impact:** High  
**Project Phase:** Early Development

**Situation:** Initially planned to use React 18 for stability, but React 19 was released during development with significant improvements for form handling and performance.

**Challenge:** Mid-project framework upgrade risk versus missing out on features that directly benefit wizard interfaces.

**Lesson:** For greenfield projects, it's worth adopting the latest stable version of core frameworks if the benefits clearly align with project requirements. React 19's form improvements were perfect for Arcana's wizard interface.

**Application:** Evaluate new framework versions not just for stability, but for feature alignment with project needs. The form handling improvements in React 19 reduced our development time by an estimated 20%.

**Preventive Measures:** Establish framework evaluation criteria early in project planning to make upgrade decisions systematically rather than reactively.

### CSS Isolation Complexity Underestimated

**Date:** April 15, 2024  
**Category:** Technical Architecture  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Project Phase:** Mid Development

**Situation:** Initial estimate for CSS isolation implementation was 1 week, but actual implementation took 3 weeks due to complex edge cases in different host environments.

**Challenge:** Host applications had varying CSS reset strategies, conflicting Tailwind versions, and different box-sizing approaches that broke Arcana's layout.

**Lesson:** CSS isolation in embedded applications requires comprehensive testing across diverse host environments. Edge cases are numerous and difficult to predict during planning.

**Application:** Always allocate 2-3x estimated time for CSS isolation work. Create a test suite with multiple host application scenarios early in development. Consider Shadow DOM for future projects despite compatibility trade-offs.

**Knowledge Gained:** Developed comprehensive CSS reset strategy and host environment testing methodology that can be reused for future embedded applications.

### Auto-save Frequency Optimization

**Date:** June 22, 2024  
**Category:** User Experience  
**Impact:** Low  
**Project Phase:** Testing

**Situation:** Initial auto-save was set to 5-second intervals, but user testing revealed this felt "too eager" and caused minor performance hiccups on slower devices.

**Challenge:** Balancing data safety with performance and user perception of system responsiveness.

**Lesson:** Auto-save frequency should be determined by user testing, not just technical capabilities. Users prefer slightly longer intervals that feel more natural.

**Application:** Implemented 10-second auto-save with immediate save on step navigation. This provides optimal balance of data safety and performance. Also added visual feedback to indicate when saves occur.

**Best Practice Established:** Always user-test auto-save behavior across different device types and user workflows.

### TypeScript Strictness Pays Off

**Date:** August 10, 2024  
**Category:** Code Quality  
**Impact:** High  
**Project Phase:** Throughout Development

**Situation:** Maintained strict TypeScript configuration throughout development despite pressure to relax rules for faster development.

**Challenge:** Some developers wanted to use `any` types or disable strict checks to move faster during tight deadlines.

**Lesson:** Strict TypeScript configuration prevented numerous runtime bugs and made refactoring much safer. The upfront investment in proper typing paid off significantly during integration and testing phases.

**Application:** Continue enforcing strict TypeScript in all future projects. The compile-time error detection saved an estimated 40+ hours of debugging time.

**Team Impact:** Team TypeScript skills improved significantly. Developers now prefer strict typing and understand its long-term benefits.
