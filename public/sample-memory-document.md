# Test Project - Memory Document

## 📋 Project Information

**Description:** This is a comprehensive test project for demonstrating the enhanced markdown import functionality with complex structures.

**Team:** John Doe, Jane Smith, Bob Johnson, Alice Wilson

## 📝 Decision Log

### Use React for Frontend

**Date:** 2025-01-01
**Status:** decided
**Description:** We decided to use React for building the user interface.
**Rationale:** React provides good component reusability and has strong community support.
**Impact:** High - This affects the entire frontend architecture and development approach.
**Stakeholders:** Frontend Team, Product Manager, CTO
**Alternatives:** Vue.js, Angular, Vanilla JavaScript

### Implement TypeScript

**Date:** 2025-01-02
**Status:** decided
**Description:** Add TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience.
**Rationale:** TypeScript catches errors at compile time and improves code maintainability.
**Impact:** Medium - Requires team training but improves code quality.
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Tech Lead
**Alternatives:** Stay with JavaScript, Use JSDoc for typing

### Database Migration Strategy

**Date:** 2025-01-05
**Status:** pending
**Description:** Evaluate options for migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL.
**Rationale:** PostgreSQL offers better JSON support and advanced features needed for new requirements.
**Impact:** High - Affects data layer and requires careful planning.
**Stakeholders:** Backend Team, Database Administrator, DevOps
**Alternatives:** Stay with MySQL, Consider MongoDB, Evaluate Aurora

## 📚 Glossary

**API:** Application Programming Interface - A set of protocols and tools for building software applications.

**Component:** A reusable piece of user interface in React that encapsulates its own state and logic.

**TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing static type checking.

**Vite:** A build tool that provides fast development server and optimized builds for modern web applications.

**CI/CD:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment - Automated processes for integrating code changes and deploying applications.

**JWT:** JSON Web Token - A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties for authentication.

## 📅 Meeting Notes

### Sprint Planning - 2025-01-03

**Attendees:** John Doe, Jane Smith, Bob Johnson, Alice Wilson, Mike Chen

**Agenda:**
- Review previous sprint outcomes
- Plan upcoming sprint features
- Discuss technical debt priorities
- Resource allocation

**Notes:**
Discussed the completion of the authentication module and planned the next sprint focusing on user dashboard implementation. The team agreed to allocate 30% of sprint capacity to addressing technical debt, particularly around the data access layer.

Key decisions made:
- Prioritize user dashboard over admin features
- Implement automated testing for critical paths
- Schedule code review sessions twice weekly

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Set up automated testing framework (John Doe - Due: 2025-01-10)
- [x] Complete API documentation (Jane Smith - Due: 2025-01-08)
- [ ] Review database optimization opportunities (Bob Johnson - Due: 2025-01-12)
- [ ] Design user dashboard mockups (Alice Wilson - Due: 2025-01-09)

### Architecture Review - 2025-01-15

**Attendees:** John Doe, Mike Chen, Sarah Lee, CTO

**Agenda:**
- Review current system architecture
- Discuss scalability concerns
- Plan microservices transition
- Security audit findings

**Notes:**
Comprehensive review of the system architecture revealed several areas for improvement. The monolithic structure is becoming a bottleneck as the team grows. Migration to microservices was approved with a phased approach.

Security audit identified minor vulnerabilities in the authentication flow that need immediate attention.

**Action Items:**
- [x] Fix authentication vulnerabilities (Mike Chen - Due: 2025-01-18)
- [ ] Create microservices migration plan (Sarah Lee - Due: 2025-01-25)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting (John Doe - Due: 2025-01-30)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Database Connection Pooling Issues

**Date:** 2025-01-20
**Category:** Technical
**Impact:** high
**Situation:** Application started experiencing intermittent database connection timeouts during peak usage periods, causing service disruptions.
**Lesson:** Connection pool configuration was inadequate for production load. Default settings worked fine in development but couldn't handle concurrent user requests.
**Application:** Always load test with realistic connection patterns. Configure connection pools based on expected concurrent users, not development usage. Implement proper monitoring for connection pool metrics.

### Communication Breakdown During Release

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Category:** Process
**Impact:** medium
**Situation:** A critical bug was discovered in production after a release because the QA team wasn't informed about a last-minute change to the payment processing logic.
**Lesson:** Changes made close to release deadlines require explicit communication to all stakeholders, even if they seem minor.
**Application:** Implement a change freeze policy 48 hours before releases. Any emergency changes must go through a formal notification process including QA, DevOps, and product teams.

### Third-Party API Rate Limiting

**Date:** 2025-01-28
**Category:** Technical
**Impact:** low
**Situation:** Integration with external payment processor started failing during high-traffic periods due to undocumented rate limits.
**Lesson:** Third-party APIs often have undocumented or poorly documented rate limits that only become apparent under load.
**Application:** Always implement exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns for external API calls. Monitor API response times and error rates. Have fallback strategies for critical integrations.
